I am unsure about this [rumoured Apple subscription service](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-17/apple-is-said-to-plan-apple-music-like-news-subscription-service),  as I do not know if it would include the kind of outlets that I would like to support. But I can see myself paying for written content that would be available on the web for free, if it was from outlets I care about and want to support, and if the presentation format has a premium feel.
