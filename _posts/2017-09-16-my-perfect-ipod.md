title: My Perfect iPod

I love my Apple Watch Series 2. I wear it every day since it came out, 365 days ago today. I have closed the blue standing ring 364 times, missing only the day it came out. It was delivered at about 15:00, too late for me to stand for a minute during twelve hours that day. The watch has undoubtedly helped me get fitter. Now the Series 3 is available for pre-order, and it looks like a great upgrade, especially with LTE networking. The Series 3 hardware has the potential to be the perfect Apple Watch for me. The software, however, needs improving.

The Apple Watch is now so close to being the perfect realisation of the dream of the iPod. I loved my first iPod as a teenager, and now still look back at it fondly despite using the iPhone every day. I had all of my podcasts, music and audiobooks on it, the latter two of which were mostly CD rips mixed with iTunes purchases. If I tried to use one now I am sure that I would quickly grow incensed at having to plug the thing in to iTunes in order to download new podcast episodes. But the iPod was a great idea.

The Apple Watch is closer to that ideal now than it ever has been. The Series 3 supports Apple Music streaming which, when combined with Bluetooth headphones, makes it a fantastic music device. But for spoken word audio, there is still a long way to go. Marco Arment, developer of my favourite podcast app Overcast, has written about the struggles he has had getting local podcast playback working on the Apple Watch. I tried the Send to Watch feature in Overcast when it was released, but it was too slow and cumbersome to replace just using the iPhone to listen to podcast episodes.

This is what is holding back the Apple Watch from the Platonic ideal of iPodness. It is the audio APIs in WatchOS. Perhaps in the future, WatchOS will inherit some of iOS’s robust support for different audio playback styles, allowing developers like Marco to write great third-party spoken audio apps for the Watch. If, one day, I can download podcasts, music and audiobooks automatically onto my Watch, it might replace my phone audio listening completely and fulfil the the dream of the iPod. But without podcast apps like Overcast and audiobook apps like Audible, the Watch will never be my perfect iPod.
