title: Watching trash - DARLING in the FRANXX

[DARLING in the FRANXX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darling_in_the_Franxx) is an anime airing in the Spring 2018 season. The premise is fairly traditional, as anime goes. Heavily inspired by [Evangelion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion), _DARLING in the FRANXX_ stars a group of young teens who have to pilot giant humanoid mocha to fight off weird and inexplicable monsters to protect humanity. So far, so anime. However, this is also a [fan service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_service) show, above and beyond the usual fan service that I have to tolerate in most anime shows. [^1]

The show's sexual politics are woven into its very premise. A boy and a girl together have to pilot one of the mecha, which the girl adopting what I will call a compromising position while the boy is positioned behind her. The language used to describe the meeting of minds necessary to pilot the mecha leaves it very clear what this is a metaphor for. The female characters are almost always framed in a way that is intended to be pleasing or titillating to the presumed straight male viewer. 

Does this make the show bad? In a way, yes. I do not want to defend that aspect of the show. Such framing makes me feel very uncomfortable - I profess myself to be a feminist, but is that undermined by the fact that I am enjoying a show that is treating its female characters with such disrespect? I hope it does not, because I have not given up watching the show. In fact, as the show has gone on I have found it to just get more interesting. When you look past the obvious fan service, the character relationships are quite engaging, on a teenage melodramatic sort of level.

The children in this world are the only ones who can pilot the mecha, and the the adults seem to keep them at arms length. Apart from the children who are dedicated pilots, there do not seem to be any other children in the cities that we see throughout the first half of the show. The pilots themselves are  obviously being kept in the dark about a lot of things, but included in that are facts about sexuality and puberty. The kids do not know what kissing is, nor where new humans come from. They seem to know nothing about adult relationships. Seeing a group of kids discover feelings for each other without the language to properly describe what they are feeling is quite compelling. What would be quite typical teen relationships are given a skewed perspective. It seems to be more self-aware of the tropes of teen relationships than most anime, which is refreshing. 

However, I cannot really recommend the show, because the visuals are giving off such a strong message that the show’s writing becomes subsumed by them.

[Lindsay Ellis](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG1h-Wqjtwz7uUANw6gazRw) is one of my favourite analysts of popular culture on the internet. I would recommend all her videos, especially her recent series about the Hobbit movies. [^2] Watching _DARLING in the FRANXX_ reminded me of one of Ellis’ videos, about Megan Fox’s character Mikaela in 2007’s _Transformers_:

In the video, Ellis talks about how Mikaela has a character that is much more developed than that of Sam, the leading male character. Mikaela has hopes and ambitions, and a goal that she is working towards that is separate from the main plot. This however is not what audiences remember about Mikaela. Instead they remember how she is framed by the camera, as a sexual object rather than as a complete character.

The same argument applies to _DARLING in the FRANXX_. No matter how complicated its writing and no matter how interesting its characters, the show is overwhelmed by the visual framing of the female characters (the male characters are framed very differently). I know the show is not trying to be high art, but it dramatically limits the potential audience of the show. Many people will see the fan service and assume what the plot is like, and will switch it off. Some may be attracted precisely because of the fan service, but I would be willing to bet that the global audience of those uncomfortable with the levels of fan service in this show greatly outnumbers the audience who are drawn to it.

This gets me back to the question I raised earlier: does watching and liking this show make me a bad feminist? Or for that matter a bad person? I do not think it does, but only because I am able to critically analyse what I am watching, and recognise where the show is failing in its depiction of women as well as the interesting messages it is trying to send. So I would recommend the show to you, too, if you are able and willing to criticise the show every time the framing paints the female characters in an objectified way. If you enjoy the show on face value without the critical analysis, I think is a reflection of the misogyny that is an undercurrent throughout almost all popular culture.
