I am a software developer specialising in developing Testing and Quality Assurance 
frameworks. With more than four years of software development experience and two drafted 
novels under my belt, I am always looking for new and exciting opportunites.

## Languages and Frameworks

* **[Java](https://www.java.com)** - [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/) / `Maven`
* **[Selenium Webdriver](https://docs.seleniumhq.org)** - `Chromedriver`
* **[Localstack](https://localstack.cloud)**
* **[Go](https://golang.org)**
* **[Docker](https://www.docker.com)**

## Open-source side projects

### [Localstack Go Wrapper](https://github.com/CallumKerrEdwards/localstack-go-wrapper) 
A library for integration testing in Go against a local version of AWS endpoints by
starting LocalStack in a docker container.
